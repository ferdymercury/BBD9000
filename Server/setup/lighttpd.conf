# This configuration file can setup a default server and optionally one or more virtual servers.
# var.root is a variable containing the full path to the site's directory structure.
#   var.root is not the document root!  It is the directory containing all BBD9000-related sub-directories for a domain.
#   The directory structure expected under var.root is:
#     web
#       fcgi-bin - configured to run perl CGI scripts in this directory. Document root for perl CGIs.
#       public - static and PHP pages. Document root for static/PHP pages
#     tmp - logs, both lighttpd and BBD9000
#     var - lighttpd sockets
#     There are other important directories under here, but they are not lighttpd's concern.
# To configure a virtual server (commented out below),
#   var.root in the virtual server configuration block should specify the path for the virtual server's file system
#      var.root for the virtual server should *NOT* be the same as the global server's var.root
#      The structure of the virtual server's file system is the same as above for the global var.root
#   The $HTTP["host"] =~ "(^|\.)test\.bbd9000\.com$" line should be modified appropriately for the domain being served
# All of the other configuration settings depend on var.root, so they don't need to change for a standard installation.
