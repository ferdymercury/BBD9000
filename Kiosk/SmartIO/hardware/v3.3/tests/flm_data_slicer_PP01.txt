IO setup:
input comparator set up as data slicer (as used for reading manchester encoding)
input connected to arduino output directly (push-pull), no additional filter cap or MOSFET.

component values:
input serial, pullup, pulldown = 10k x 3
slicer RC on - input = 4.7k, 0.22uF
comp hysteresis = 100k feedback, 4.7k on + input

Summary:
  positive pulses:
    500 us pulse width minimum @ 10 & 100 pulses/sec.
    200 us pulse width minimum @ 1000 pulses/sec.
   1000 us pulse width is the pwm-imposed minimum with 1 pulse/sec - fully detected.

  negative pulses:
    500 us pulse width minimum @ 10 & 100 pulses/sec.
    200 us pulse width minimum @ 1000 pulses/sec.
   1000 us pulse width is the pwm-imposed minimum with 1 pulse/sec - fully detected.
