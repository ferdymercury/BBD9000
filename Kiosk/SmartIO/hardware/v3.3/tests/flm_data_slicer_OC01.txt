IO setup:
input comparator set up as data slicer (as used for reading manchester encoding)
input connected to arduino output via N-MOSFET (open collector), no additional filter cap.

component values:
input serial, pullup, pulldown = 10k x 3
slicer RC on - input = 4.7k, 0.22uF
comp hysteresis = 100k feedback, 4.7k on + input
