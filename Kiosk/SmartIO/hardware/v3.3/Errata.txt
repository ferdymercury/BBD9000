Errata in v3.3.2
The 3.3.2 boards are functional with some modifications.

Assembly of V3.3.2 boards:
The Labels for R1 and R2 are reversed
The pins (not the circuit) for OlinuXino Rx and Tx are reversed
  This requires two trace cuts and two green wires
  Bottom, on back, two pairs of vias are used for Rx and Tx
  Cut the traces b/w the two vias, use wires to connect them in reverse
The right angle headers for keypad and LCD are too close together for two IDC ribbon connectors
  Use non-IDC stackable connectors with crimp terminals.
The 2.5 Vref is too low for DRSN and AUX inputs.
  Change R18 to 5k

Layout changes for 3.3.3 do not require a new stencil.
  The pads for 2W resistors were made slightly narrower.
  Traces were made wider where possible, and some fill zones were added.
