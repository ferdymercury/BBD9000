Errata in v3.3.2
The 3.3.2 boards are functional with some modifications.

Assembly of V3.3.2 boards:
The Labels for R1 and R2 are reversed
The pins (not the circuit) for OlinuXino Rx and Tx are reversed
  This requires two trace cuts and two green wires
  Bottom, on back, two pairs of vias are used for Rx and Tx
  Cut the traces b/w the two vias, use wires to connect them in reverse
The right angle headers for keypad and LCD are too close together for two IDC ribbon connectors
  Use non-IDC stackable connectors with crimp terminals.
The 2.5 Vref is too low for DRSN and AUX inputs.
  Change R18 to 5k

Layout changes for 3.3.3 do not require a new stencil.
  The pads for 2W resistors were made slightly narrower.
  Traces were made wider where possible, and some fill zones were added.

R25, R31, Cb8, U7pin8 should connect to 5Vout, not 5V
  to protect the 5V supply from input transients.

UPS capacitor bank needs current limit
  Add 2x through-hole 75 ohm 3W resistor (R44/R45) in series b/w C12 pin1(+) and D8 (instead of direct-connect)
  Add D11 (sames as D1-4, etc.) parallel to series resistor (points at D8) to discharge UPS through diode instead of R
    v3.3.2 correction: free-build 2xR+D11 on C12 pin1 (bend C12p1 up along C body). Lead D11 cathode to board's C12+ pad.

12V input needs undervoltage cutoff
  Without shutoff, the circuit continues to drain the battery after shutdown.
  Problem mainly in 12V/solar applications.
  Use LM192 as window comparator to shutdown < 10V > 15V
  Replace PTC fuse with ZXCT1032, AUIR3315 use same TVS as on dig inputs (high-V replaced by comparator)
  AUIR with 3k Rifb has 10A current limit (which is probably OK).
  **10V is way too low in low-load.  An idle system, drawing < .1CA needs to shutdown @ 11.5V or higher!
    At the same time, a 0.3 C load may drop the voltage to 10.5V.
    A fixed cutoff is useless on lead-acid systems.
  
  Variable cutoff:
    High cutoff set by voltage detector for turn-on.  11.5 - 12 V.

    Vref (low cath current, high cath voltage, Vref=1.25), $0.65:

    Voltage detector has software over-ride for maintaining on-state with higher loads
    Software enables/disables over-ride depending on pump status, or measured load (requires current accuracy).
    Override - pull-down of PFET gate using DIO output.
    Gate gets pulled down automatically using voltage detector.
    Voltage detector:  Use another dual comparator and a Vref (new) to monitor 12V input voltage and 5V regulator input voltage
    Comparators pull down PFET gates to turn on high-side.

    Comparator/Vref advantage: Vref can also be used to calibrate analog inputs.
      Shunt Adjustable Vref used without comparator: smaller component count, but no Vref out.
      ~4V high enough without being too high (Vref must be <= Vcc):
        4.096V 0.1% $3.01: http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/LM4050AIM3-4.1%2FNOPB/LM4050AIM3-4.1%2FNOPBCT-ND/364017
        4.096V 0.2% $2.07: http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/TL4050B41QDBZT/296-32350-1-ND/3506198
        standard resistors in BOM are 0.5%
      voltage divide Vin to 4V
      Vin min of 11.5V
