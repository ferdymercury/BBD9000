Conduit fittings (1/2”):
Power  (Blk-Wht-Grn 110 V AC)
Pump   (Red-Wht-Grn 110 V AC)
Signal (FLM,STK,LGHT,ETH,ANT)

Color codes:

Power (110 V AC):
Black:  AC hot – to breaker
White:  neutral
Grn:    ground

Pump (110 V AC):
Red:   switched hot
white: neutral
Grn:   ground

Power (12 V DC):
black: positive
white: negative
Grn:   ground

Pump (12 V DC):
Red:   switched positive
white: negative
Grn:   ground

STK:
  Red:  Stk+ (+12 V electric strike coil)
  Blk:  Stk- (switched GND electric strike coil)
  Wht:  DRSN, door sensor, open-collector, internal 5k 5V pullup.
  Grn:  Gnd
  N.B.: The DRSN/white wire must never see more than 5 V.
    Voltages higher than 5V will destroy the SmartIO board!

LGHT:
  Red+Blk: LGHT+ (+12 V for motion-controlled lighting)
  Wht+Grn: LGHT- (switched ground for lighting)

FLM:
  Blk: FLM1 pulse (edge) sensor 1, open-collector, internal 5k 5V pullup.
  Wht: FLM2 pulse (edge) sensor 2, open-collector, internal 5k 5V pullup.
  Grn: GND  Ground
  Red:  5V  5V power for flowmeter (if necessary).
  N.B.: The FLM1/FLM2 wires must never see more than 5 V.
    Voltages higher than 5V will destroy the SmartIO board!
