SmartIO API (RS232 interface)
Default RS232 interface settings: 115200 baud, 8 bit, no parity, 1 stop bit (8N1).
General syntax:
<PERIPHERAL>[<TAB><VALUE>]0..n<NEWLINE>
Note that angle brackets ('<', '>') are used to delineate the fields and field-separators.
Square brackets ('[',']') are used to designate optional entries.
Brackets are not part of the syntax.  <TAB> is a single tab character.
<PERIPHERAL> is text referring to the sub-system/peripheral being commanded or queried (ex. LCD1, RLY1, AUX, etc).
  generally, the peripheral name corresponds to labeled components on the circuit board.
Following the command is zero or more <TAB>-delimited values.
  generally, the peripheral name alone (without any values) will return its current setting (i.e ADC1, VIN, PMP).
The command is terminated by a newline (any combination of one or more carriage-returns (^m), newlines (^n) or linefeeds (^r)).

There are several events that are initiated by the SmartI/O board, which means the board sends a message without
being initiated by a query.

Commands and Queries:
  Allmost all of these commands can be used to set a setting or report a current value.
LCD1<TAB>Text
  Text appears on the first line of the LCD.  Any remaining text positions on the 1st line of the LCD are cleared.
LCD2<TAB>Text
  Sames as LCD1, but for the second line.
LCDBL[<TAB> 0 or 1]
  Zero or 1 for the value turns the LCD back-light off and on respectively.
  The bare command reports the current setting.
RLY1[<TAB> 0 or 1]
  Turns the on-board Relay on and off.
  The bare command reports the current setting.
  The relay is optically isolated and rated for 70 Amps AC/DC.
  The circuit traces should not carry more than ~30 amps.
LGHT[<TAB> 0 or 1]
  Turns the LGHT output (lights, normally) on and off.
  The bare command reports the current setting.
  This solid-state relay switches ground, and can take a 2 Amp load.
STK[<TAB> 0 or 1]
  Turns the STK (electric strike) on and off.
  The bare command reports the current setting.
  This solid-state relay switches ground, and can take a 2 Amp load.
AUX[<TAB> 0 or 1]
  Turns the AUX (auxiliary output) on and off.
  The bare command reports the current setting.
  This solid-state relay switches ground, and can take a 2 Amp load.
FLM-CUR[<TAB>value]
  Normally used to clear the flowmeter counter, but can be used to set it to any value
  This is a 32-bit unsigned integer.
  The bare command reports the current value.
  Note that flowmeter values are not calibrated - this is simply the number of pulses counted.
FLM-MS[<TAB>value]
  This is the shortest amount of time to wait between flowmeter events.
  This speed limit is necessary because otherwise an event will be sent for every pulse edge (potentially several hundred per second)
  Values of 50-100 ms are reasonable (many LCD displays will take 100ms to refresh).  Default is 50.
  The bare command reports the current value.
FLM-TOT[<TAB>value]
  This is a cumulative flowmeter counter, which maintains the count through power-cycles.
  It can also be reset by specifying a value.
  The counter is a 32-bit unsigned integer (4,294,967,296 pulses max.  This is 5,368,709 gallons using a flowmeter with 800 pulses/gallon).
  The bare command returns the current number of pulses.
VIN
  Reports the current calibrated voltage on Vin (as a floating-point number in volts).
VRAW
  Reports the current raw ADC reading on Vin.
VCAL[<TAB><RAW1><TAB><CAL1><TAB><RAW2><TAB><CAL2>]
  ADC calibration values for voltage (Vin).  RAW1 is the first (low) raw ADC reading, CAL1 is the corresponding low calibrated voltage.
  The RAW2 is the second (high) raw ADC reading, and CAL2 is the high calibration voltage.
  The voltage resolution is ~10 millivolts.  Calibrated values can range from 0.0 - 655.36 and raw values from 0 - 1024.
  The bare command reports the current values.
  Defaults:
  VCAL	100	0	782	14.82

VIN-THR<TAB><alarm on voltage><TAB><alarm off voltage>
  The threshold voltages of Vin at which to send and reset a VALRM event.  VALRM events are sent only once until a subsequent VOK event.
  Default is 10.50 V for the alarm-on voltage and 11.50 V for the alarm-off voltage
  The bare command reports the current values.
PMP
  Reports the current calibrated amperage reading as a floating-point number (amps).
  Note that AC currents are read as the maxima of the sine-wave, which is 1.414 times the RMS current.
IRAW
  Reports the current raw ADC reading on the relay current sensor.
ICAL<TAB><RAW1><TAB><CAL1><TAB><RAW2><TAB><CAL2>
  ADC calibration values for current through RLY1.  RAW1 is the first (low) raw ADC reading.
  CAL1 is the corresponding low calibrated current (i.e. 50.00 is 50 amps).
  RAW2 is the second (high) raw ADC reading, and CAL2 is the corresponding high calibration current.
  The amperage resolution is ~100 milliamps.  Calibrated values can range from 0.0 - 655.36 and raw values from 0 - 1024.
  The bare command reports the current values.
  Defaults:
  ICAL	127	0	615	50.00
PMP-THR<TAB><pump on current><TAB><pump off current>
  The threshold currents for sending "pump on" and "pump off" events.  "Pump on" events are sent only once until a subsequent "Pump off" event.
  Default is 1.5 amp for the pump-on current and 0.6 for the pump-off current.
  The bare command reports the current values.
MTN[<TAB>0 or 1]
  This is used to set the logic of the motion sensor.  It can be interpreted as "sensor value when motion is happening".
  The bare command reports wether or not there is currently motion (not the logic setting).
MTN-MS[<TAB>value (ms)]
  This is used to set the amount of time to wait (in ms) from the motion detector detecting no further motion to a "MTN stopped" event being sent.
  Motion sensors typically cycle rapidly, so a high value is recommended here - several seconds. 65535 is maximum.
  The bare command reports the current value.
DRSN<TAB>0 or 1
  This is used to set the logic of the door sensor.  It can be interpreted as "sensor value when door is open".
  The bare command reports wether or not the door is open (not the logic setting).
RESET
  This command causes a reboot of the SmartIO board, equivalent to cycling power to the board.

Events (these are messages sent by the board without an initial query)
  FLM<TAB>current pulses
    not cummulative, equivalent to FLM-CUR.  Occurs whenever flowmeter state changes (edge-triggered)
  KP<TAB>key
    Keypad key.  Keys are non-repeating.
  MTN-STRT
    Motion started
  MTN-STOP
    Motion stopped
  DRSN-OPND
    Door Opened
  DRSN-CLSD
    Door Closed
  VALRM-STRT
    Voltage Alarm
  VALRM-STOP
    Voltage Alarm Reset
  PMP-ON
    Pump ON
  PMP-OFF
    Pump OFF
  MSR<TAB>track 1<TAB>track 2
    Tracks are read directly off of the card and reported with the sentinel characters removed
